# Overview

Experiments involving VAEs with discrete latent representations. Findings are [here](notebooks/plots.ipynb).

- Samples when model is trained with the KL term evaluated using Gumbel-Softmax distributions: ![](output_kl_relax/samples/samples_epoch_10.png)
- Samples when model is trained with the KL term evaluated using Categorical distributions: ![](output_kl_categorical/samples/samples_epoch_10.png)
